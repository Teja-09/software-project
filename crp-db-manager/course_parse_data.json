India is a country where history, culture, art, aesthetics, cuisine and nature exhibit more diversity than nearly anywhere else in the world. Amrita Values Programmes emphasize on making students familiar with the rich tapestry of Indian life, culture, arts, science and heritage which has historically drawn people from all over the world. Students shall have to register for any two of the following courses, one each in the third and the fourth semesters, which may be offered by the respective school during the concerned semester. Courses offered under the framework of Amrita Values Programmes I and II Message from Amma\u2122s Life for the Modern World Amma\u2122s messages can be put to action in our life through pragmatism and attuning of our thought process in a positive and creative manner. Every single word Amma speaks and the guidance received in on matters which we consider as trivial are rich in content and touches the very inner being of our personality. Life gets enriched by Amma\u2122s guidance and She teaches us the art of exemplary life skills where we become witness to all the happenings around us still keeping the balance of the mind.

Insights into Indian Arts and Literature The aim of this course is to present the rich literature and culture of Ancient India and help students appreciate their deep influence on Indian Life - Vedic culture, primary source of Indian Culture \u0152 Brief introduction and appreciation of a few of the art forms of India - Arts, Music, Dance, Theatre. Yoga and Meditation The objective of the course is to provide practical training in YOGA ASANAS with a sound theoretical base and theory classes on selected verses of Patanjali\u2122s Yoga Sutra and Ashtanga Yoga. The coverage also includes the effect of yoga on integrated personality development. Kerala Mural Art and Painting Mural painting is an offshoot of the devotional tradition of Kerala. A mural is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other large permanent surface. In the contemporary scenario Mural painting is not restricted to the permanent structures and are being done even on canvas. Kerala mural paintings are the frescos depicting mythology and legends, which are drawn on the walls of temples and churches in South India, principally in Kerala. Ancient temples, churches and places in Kerala, South India, display an abounding tradition of mural paintings mostly dating back between the 9th to 12th centuries when this Schools of Engineering Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham 2015 admissions onwards SYLLABI B.

Learning Mural painting through the theory and practice workshop is the objective of this course. Course on Organic Farming and Sustainability Organic farming is emerging as an important segment of human sustainability and healthy life. Haritamritam\u2122 is an attempt to empower the youth with basic skills in tradition of organic farming and to revive the culture of growing vegetables that one consumes, without using chemicals and pesticides. Growth of Agriculture through such positive initiatives will go a long way in nation development. In Amma\u2122s words \ufb01it is a big step in restoring the lost harmony of nature\ufb01. Benefits of Indian Medicinal Systems Indian medicinal systems are one of the most ancient in the world. Even today society continues to derive enormous benefits from the wealth of knowledge in Ayurveda of which is recognised as a viable and sustainable medicinal tradition. This course will expose students to the fundamental principles and philosophy of Ayurveda and other Indian medicinal traditions. Traditional Fine Arts of India India is home to one of the most diverse Art forms world over. The underlying philosophy of Indian life is \u201a\u00danity in Diversity\ufb02 and it has led to the most diverse expressions of culture in India. Most art forms of India are an expression of devotion by the devotee towards the Lord and its influence in Indian life is very pervasive. This course will introduce students to the deeper philosophical basis of Indian Art forms and attempt to provide a practical demonstration of the continuing relevance of the Art. Science of Worship in India Indian mode of worship is unique among the world civilisations. Nowhere in the world has the philosophical idea of reverence and worshipfulness for everything in this universe found universal acceptance as it in India. Indian religious life even today is a practical demonstration of the potential for realisation of this profound truth. To see the all-pervading consciousness in everything, including animate and inanimate, and constituting society to realise this truth can be seen as the epitome of civilizational excellence. This course will discuss the principles and rationale behind different modes of worship prevalent in India."}, "textbooks": {}, "references": {}}, "Reviews": [], "Questions": []}, "15CHY100": {"courseCode": "15CHY100", "courseName": "CHEMISTRY", "courseDescription": {"units": {"Unit 1": "Chemical Bonding Review of orbital concept and electronic configuration, electrovalency and ionic bond formation, ionic compounds and their properties, lattice energy, solvation enthalpy and solubility of ionic compounds, covalent bond, covalency, orbital theory of covalency - sigma and pi bonds - formation of covalent compounds and their properties.
